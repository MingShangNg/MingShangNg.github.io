			<h1>Problem Solving</h1>
			<p>Think like a programmer! Problem solving is a very important skill as a programmer because they need to
				think and develop more effective ways for problem solving. </p>
			<h2>Block on a simple problem</h2>
			<p>During week 4 on foundation, I have some trouble solving the JavaScript Kata Built-in Method deBee
				problem. At the beginning, I didn't understand what the problem was asking and I didn't understand what
				the function parameter value was. The first problem solving technique is to try to write random code so
				I can read the error messages. Once I understood the error messages, I realized I can use the
				console.log method to find out function parameter value. Finally I understand the problem is wanting to
				remove the word “buzz” from the sentences and I was able to solve it with some googling. During this
				process, I feel like JavaScript problems are like puzzles. We really need to understand all the pieces
				so toward the end we can connect and solve the problems. I learned about how to use console.logging and
				trying something by solving this problem. </p>

			<h2>Elegantly solved problem</h2>
			<p>I have a new problem after I solve the deBee which is my code. I feel like my code is too long and
				repeats itself too much. I use google to find a better method to solve this problem (using the
				“toLowerCase()”). During the process, I felt quite challenged to solve it and learned about the
				importance of tidy and keeping short code.</p>
			<h2>Problem solving techniques:</h2>
			<h3>Pseudocode</h3>
			<p>
				I am trying to improve myself on this technique by starting to write
				some pseudocode before I start writing the code.
			</p>
			<h3>Trying something</h3>
			<p>Use this method a lot in JavaScript Kata. I always try to write some code on it to check whether my code
				is right or wrong.</p>
			<h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
			<p>
				I tried to use this method. I found it quite useful because it allows me
				to explain what the problem is.
			</p>
			<h3>Reading error messages</h3>
			<p>
				I am quite confident with reading error messages because it always shows
				where the error is and what is happening.
			</p>
			<h3>Console.logging</h3>
			<p>
				Use this technique a lot to console log my code to see whether it is
				working.
			</p>
			<h3>Googling</h3>
			<p>
				One of my favorite methods. I use google a lot. On Stack Overflow and
				youtube.
			</p>
			<h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
			<p>
				Don’t really use this method yet because now everything is online. I
				find it hard to explain my problems in chat messages. I much prefer face
				to face when asking the question.
			</p>
			<h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
			<p>
				Don’t really use this method yet because now everything is online. I
				find it hard to explain my problems in chat messages. I much prefer face
				to face when asking the question.
			</p>
			<h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
			<p>
				I try to improve this method by giving myself more time for reflection
				because sometimes I always feel like I'm rushing everything at a fast
				pace.
