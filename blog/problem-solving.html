      <h2>What was the problem?</h2>
      <p>The first problem that I have is how to find the average array.</p>

      <h2>What problem solving techniques did I use?</h2>
      <p>
        The technique I use is google. I googled how to find the average array
        and watch some youtube videos.
      </p>
      <h2>How did I feel throughout the process?</h2>
      <p>
        During the process, I try to understand how other people write their
        code.
      </p>
      <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
      <p>
        That is a lot of ways to write different code. I need to understand and
        learn more about the logic of how to write code.
      </p>
      <h2>Problem solving techniques:</h2>
      <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
      <p>
        I am trying to improve myself on this technique by starting to write
        some pseudocode before I start writing the code.
      </p>
      <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
      <p>
        I tried to use this method. I found it quite useful because it allows me
        to explain what the problem is.
      </p>
      <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
      <p>
        I am quite confident with reading error messages because it always shows
        where the error is and what is happening.
      </p>
      <h3>Console.logging</h3>
      <p>
        Use this technique a lot to console log my code to see whether it is
        working.
      </p>
      <h3>Googling</h3>
      <p>
        One of my favorite methods. I use google a lot. On Stack Overflow and
        youtube.
      </p>
      <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
      <p>
        Don’t really use this method yet because now everything is online. I
        find it hard to explain my problems in chat messages. I much prefer face
        to face when asking the question.
      </p>
      <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
      <p>
        Don’t really use this method yet because now everything is online. I
        find it hard to explain my problems in chat messages. I much prefer face
        to face when asking the question.
      </p>
      <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
      <p>
        I try to improve this method by giving myself more time for reflection
        because sometimes I always feel like I'm rushing everything at a fast
        pace.
