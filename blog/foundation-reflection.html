            <h1>Core Reflection</h1>

            <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
            <p>Three new things that I learned from the core learning during the foundation are my personal values,
                different types of intelligence and different types of mindset.</p>
            <p>During the first two week of the foundation allowed me to explore more and understand my personal values.
                Third and fourth week allowed me to research and understand the importance of EQ and have the right
                mindset. (Growth mindset)</p>

            <h2>What are the roles of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
            <p>Empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming are important. Be kind to yourself and other
                people, understand that there will always be a challenge to learn new things and everyone is different.
            </p>

            <h2>What has surprised you the most about core learning?</h2>
            <p>The thing that surprised me about core learning is there are still a lot of things I can learn through
                exploring my values, mindset, strengths and weaknesses.</p>

            <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
            <p>The most challenging aspect of core learning for me is to express my feelings to others because I am
                introverted. </p>

            <h2>What do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
                development Bootcamp course?</h2>
            <p>I think the Dev academy does a great job on core learning during foundation. This allows the students to
                have some time to explore and understand themselves. </p>

            <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used
                that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
            <p>No, I think core learning is a very useful skill. It can help people reduce stress when they try to learn
                new things and it is very useful in programming because there are a lot of team projects for
                programming. </p>
