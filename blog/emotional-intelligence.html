      <h2>What is EQ?</h2>
      <p>
        EQ ( Emotional Quotient or emotional intelligence) is defined as an
        individual’s ability to identify, assess, and control the emotions of
        oneself and of other groups. The term “emotional intelligence” was used
        in 1985 in a doctoral thesis “A Study of Emotion: Developing Emotional
        Intelligence” by Wayne Payne. It became popular in 1995 after the
        publication of Daniel Goleman’s best selling book “Emotional
        Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ'' and it started a global
        movement to push EQ into practice in businesses, schools and communities
        around the world. The popular tests for EQ are Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Test
        (emotion-based problem-solving tasks) and Daniel Goleman Model Score (
        based on emotional competencies).

      <h2>What is IQ?</h2>
      <p>
        IQ (Intelligence Quotient) is a score derived from standardized tests
        that are designed to measure human intelligence. The first modern IQ
        test was developed in 1904 by Alfred Binet (1857-1991) and Theodore
        SImon (1873-1961) in French. IQ test is used to measure an individual's
        ability to learn, understand and apply information to skills, logical
        reasoning, word comprehension, math skills, abstract and spatial
        thinking, and filter irrelevant information. The popular tests for IQ
        are Stanford-Binet test, Wechsler and Woodcock-Johnson Tests of
        Cognitive Abilities.

      <h2>Why is EQ Important?</h2>
      <p>
        Historically, IQ was believed to be the best measure for “success” in
        careers and life in general, but there are studies that show that there
        is a link EQ can also affect that measurement. Higher EQ can provide
        individuals with the ability to manage their stress and emotions,
        working and socializing in a team.
