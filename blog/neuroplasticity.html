            <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
            <p>
                Back in the day, scientists thought our brain was static and unchanged
                but recent studies show that this is false. In fact our brain is
                constantly changing and adaptable. This is called Neuroplasticity
            </p>
            <p>
                How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people?
                Neuroplasticity refers to the brainâ€™s ability to reorganize itself by
                forming new neural connections throughout life. Neuroplasticity is a
                lifelong phenomenon, which means our brain is constantly changing at any
                time with repeated and specialized training/ instruction even an injured
                brain can change and recover. The brain can change itself in three
                different ways:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Chemical. The brain functions by transferring chemical signals between
                    brain cells which are neurons and this triggers the action and
                    reaction. Each time the brain learns new things, the brain can
                    increase the concentration of chemical signals for neurons. Because
                    this way can change rapidly so it is only good for short term memory.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Brain Structure. Each time the brain learns new things, the brain will
                    start changing the structure between the neurons. Changing the
                    structure of the brain takes a long time so it means this type of
                    change is for long term memory.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Alternate function in part of the brain. Each time the brain learns
                    new things, the different parts of the brain will start to activate.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The benefits of neuroplasticity to people are ability to learn new
                things, enhance existing cognitive capabilities, recovery from brain
                injuries, strengthening areas if some functions are lost or decline and
                improvements that can boost brain fitness.
            </p>

                How might you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own
                benefit?
            </h2>
            <p>
                We can engage the principles of neuroplasticity for our own benefit by
                focusing our behavior
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Having a positive mind.</li>
                <li>Identify good habits and bad habits.</li>
                <li>Challenging our brains and practicing more.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
            <p>
                According to this website, there are few methods that have been shown to
                enhance or boost neuroplasticity such as intermittent fasting ,
                traveling, etc. </p>

            <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
            <p>
                Growth mindset is the mindset for individuals who believe their work and talents can develop through
                hard work, work plan and with help from others. Having a growth mindset is important because it can help
                individuals to overcome obstacles when learning or developing new skills. During this exploration, I
                found out the importance of having a growth mindset. It can give me more freedom and learn more new
                skills. Having a growth mindset is very important with my learning journey because it can help me become
                more comfortable facing new challenges and accepting having mistakes is a good opportunity to learn and
                grow.

            <h2>Learning plan and strategies</h2>
            <p>
                Understanding Neuroplasticity and growth mindsets allow me to integrate into my learning plan and
                strategies. It can help me to identify what is my limit at the moment and believe myself there is more
                room to improve.
