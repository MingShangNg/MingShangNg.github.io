      <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
      <p>
        Back in the day, scientists thought our brain was static and unchanged
        but recent studies show that this is false. In fact our brain is
        constantly changing and adaptable. This is called Neuroplasticity
      </p>
      <p>
        How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people?
        Neuroplasticity refers to the brainâ€™s ability to reorganize itself by
        forming new neural connections throughout life. Neuroplasticity is a
        lifelong phenomenon, which means our brain is constantly changing at any
        time with repeated and specialized training/ instruction even an injured
        brain can change and recover. The brain can change itself in three
        different ways:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Chemical. The brain functions by transferring chemical signals between
          brain cells which are neurons and this triggers the action and
          reaction. Each time the brain learns new things, the brain can
          increase the concentration of chemical signals for neurons. Because
          this way can change rapidly so it is only good for short term memory.
        </li>
        <li>
          Brain Structure. Each time the brain learns new things, the brain will
          start changing the structure between the neurons. Changing the
          structure of the brain takes a long time so it means this type of
          change is for long term memory.
        </li>
        <li>
          Alternate function in part of the brain. Each time the brain learns
          new things, the different parts of the brain will start to activate.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The benefits of neuroplasticity to people are ability to learn new
        things, enhance existing cognitive capabilities, recovery from brain
        injuries, strengthening areas if some functions are lost or decline and
        improvements that can boost brain fitness.
      </p>

      <h2>
        How might you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own
        benefit?
      </h2>
      <p>
        We can engage the principles of neuroplasticity for our own benefit by
        focusing our behavior
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Having a positive mind.</li>
        <li>Identify good habits and bad habits.</li>
        <li>Challenging our brains and practicing more.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
      <p>
        According to this website, there are few methods that have been shown to
        enhance or boost neuroplasticity such as intermittent fasting ,
        traveling, etc. Here is the link for more information

      <h2>Growth Mindset: What it is and why it is relevant</h2>
      <p>
        Growth mindset is the mindset for individuals who believe their work and
        talents can develop through hard work, work plan and with help from
        others. Having a growth mindset is important because it can help
        individuals to overcome obstacles when learning or developing new
        skills.
      </p>
      <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
      <p>
        Before this exploration, I already exposed myself to the growth mindset
        from my parents. When I was young, my parents always taught me to be
        strong and work hard and believe that I can improve myself.
      </p>
      <h2>
        How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I have been integrating a growth mindset in my life journey. One example
        is running half marathons. My first half marathon goal is to run under
        two hours. I made a good routine and trained myself and I was able to
        finish it in 1 hour 55 minutes. My second half marathon goal is to run
        under 1 hour 45 mins. And again I trained myself and I was able to
        finish it in 1 hours 39 mins.
      </p>
      <h2>
        How these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and
        strategy.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Understanding Neuroplasticity and growth mindsets allow me to identify
        what is my limit at the moment and believe myself there is more room to
        improve.
