      <h2>Long term goal and career path</h2>
      <p>
        I hope I can find a career in the tech industry as a software developer
        (frontend, backend or fullstack) after finishing this course. Hopefully
        this can help me to find and secure a better pay job so I can work my
        way toward financial independence.
      </p>

      <h2>Strength and Weakness in relation to learning</h2>
      <p>
        My strengths in relation to learning are enthusiasm and hard-working.
        Whenever facing problems at learning, I will give all my best ability to
        research and solve the problems. My weaknesses in relation to learning
        are being shy and overloading myself. During my whole learning process,
        I found out that I am quite shy to ask other people for help because I
        donâ€™t want to bother other people. Sometimes this can cause me to
        overworking myself.
      </p>
      <h2>Skills like to developed while at Dev Academy</h2>
      <p>
        The skills that I like to develop more at Dev Academy are social and
        writing skills. I hope I can express my thoughts in a better way to
        other people and improve my writing skills.
      </p>
      <h2>Commitment to this program</h2>
      <p>
        The commitment to this program is to discipline myself to create a good
        schedule and habit to study. By discipline myself to follow the schedule
        allows me to have freedom to create boundaries between my study life and
        regular life. If anything is building up and starting to get to me, I
        will make sure to ask for help or take some break.
      </p>
      <h2>Expect from the facilitation team</h2>
      <p>
        The expectation from the facilitation team that I have is to help me
        when I need help and give constructive criticism so that I can improve
        myself in the future.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Scheduling information and how and where I will seek help in a timely
        way.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Before I enrolled in this course, I already scheduled a time plan for
        this. already communicated with all my family members and friends that I
        will be fully committed to this course. I am really lucky because I am
        still single (less responsibility for others, more freedom) and I
        already saved up some money so that I can study full time during this
        period. If there are problems, I will try to solve them within the
        proper time . If I am still stuck with it, then I will seek some help
        from others.
