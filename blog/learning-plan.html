      <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
      <h2>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>
      <h3>Long term goal and career pathway</h3>
      <p>My goal right now is to be able to finish and pass the Bootcamp. I hope I can gain more knowledge on coding
        skills so that I can build myself more confidence in working with other people and hopefully be able to get a
        job in the tech industry. </p>
      <h3>Biggest strengths and limitation in Bootcamp</h3>
      <p>Throughout the foundation, my strengths have really helped me to solve most of my problems. I really enjoy
        solving JavaScript problems by myself. I still need to improve my weakness, which is knowing when is the time to
        ask others for help. </p>
      <h3>Biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp</h3>
      <p>The biggest non-technical challenge for me at bootcamp will be my writing and social skills because English is
        my second language and I am introverted</p>
      <h3>Human skills developed while at Bootcamp</h3>
      <p>I hope I can improve and learn how to give constructive feedback and be able to express my opinion when working
        within the groups.</p>
      <h3>Expectations from the Bootcamp team</h3>
      <p>The expectations from the Bootcamp team that I have is to be able help each other when needed. Able to give
        constructive feedback and have proper communication.</p>
      <h3>Expectation of myself on Bootcamp</h3>
      <p>After experience of the foundation, the main expectation for myself on Bootcamp is to follow the Bootcamp Daily
        Routine. As I mentioned before, I already scheduled my time plan for the Bootcamp. I have already communicated
        with my family and friends that I will be fully committed and prioritize the Bootcamp. I am really lucky because
        I am still single (more freedom) so that I have more time focusing on the Bootcamp. </p>

      <h2>Foundation Learning Plan</h2>
      <h3>Long term goal and career path</h3>
      <p>
        I hope I can find a career in the tech industry as a software developer
        (frontend, backend or fullstack) after finishing this course. Hopefully
        this can help me to find and secure a better pay job so I can work my
        way toward financial independence.
      </p>

      <h3>Strength and Weakness in relation to learning</h3>
      <p>
        My strengths in relation to learning are enthusiasm and hard-working.
        Whenever facing problems at learning, I will give all my best ability to
        research and solve the problems. My weaknesses in relation to learning
        are being shy and overloading myself. During my whole learning process,
        I found out that I am quite shy to ask other people for help because I
        donâ€™t want to bother other people. Sometimes this can cause me to
        overworking myself.
      </p>
      <h3>Skills like to developed while at Dev Academy</h3>
      <p>
        The skills that I like to develop more at Dev Academy are social and
        writing skills. I hope I can express my thoughts in a better way to
        other people and improve my writing skills.
      </p>
      <h3>Commitment to this program</h3>
      <p>
        The commitment to this program is to discipline myself to create a good
        schedule and habit to study. By discipline myself to follow the schedule
        allows me to have freedom to create boundaries between my study life and
        regular life. If anything is building up and starting to get to me, I
        will make sure to ask for help or take some break.
      </p>
      <h3>Expect from the facilitation team</h3>
      <p>
        The expectation from the facilitation team that I have is to help me
        when I need help and give constructive criticism so that I can improve
        myself in the future.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Scheduling information and how and where I will seek help in a timely
        way.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Before I enrolled in this course, I already scheduled a time plan for
        this. already communicated with all my family members and friends that I
        will be fully committed to this course. I am really lucky because I am
        still single (less responsibility for others, more freedom) and I
        already saved up some money so that I can study full time during this
        period. If there are problems, I will try to solve them within the
        proper time . If I am still stuck with it, then I will seek some help
        from others.
