      <h2>Long term goal and career path</h2>
        <p>I hope I can find a career in the tech industry as a software developer
          (frontend, backend or fullstack) after finishing this course. Hopefully
          this can help me to find and secure a better pay job so I can work my way
          toward financial independence.
        </p>

    <h2>Strength and Weakness in relation to learning</h2>
        <p>My strengths in relation to learning are enthusiasm and hard-working.
          Whenever facing problems at learning, I will give all my best ability to
          research and solve the problems. My weaknesses in relation to learning are
          being shy and overloading myself. During my whole learning process, I
          found out that I am quite shy to ask other people for help because I donâ€™t
          want to bother other people. Sometimes this can cause me to overworking
          myself.
        </p>
    <h2>Skills like to developed while at Dev Academy</h2>
        <p>The skills that I like to develop more at Dev Academy are social and
          writing skills. I hope I can express my thoughts in a better way to other
          people and improve my writing skills.
        </p>
    <h2>Commitment to this program</h2>
        <p>The commitment to this program is to discipline myself to create a good
          schedule and habit to study. By discipline myself to follow the schedule
          allows me to have freedom to create boundaries between my study life and
          regular life. If anything is building up and starting to get to me, I will
          make sure to ask for help or take some break.
    </p>
    <h2>Expect from the facilitation team</h2>
        <p>The expectation from the facilitation team that I have is to help me when
          I need help and give constructive criticism so that I can improve myself
          in the future.
