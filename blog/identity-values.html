      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Ming Shang Ng. I was born in Malaysia and moved to New
        Zealand when I was sixteen. I finished my high school here but dropped
        out of university because I didn’t like university. I have been working
        at supermarkets for at least six years (part time and full time). I
        changed my career path from supermarket to hospitality (cooking and
        baking) because I can’t see any more opportunities for me in the
        supermarket.I have been working in hospitality for four years and I
        really like it until covid pandemic happens. During the covid pandemic,
        the hospitality industry got hit pretty badly. This pandemic really made
        me anxious and think about my future career path in hospitality.
        Fortunately, I have great support from my family during the pandemic. My
        brother advises me to change my career path to the tech industry since I
        spend a lot of time on my computer and so I follow it.
      </p>
      <h3>Personal Value & Culture</h3>
      <p>
        I grew up with a family of five (youngest in the family) in Malaysia.
        When I was young, I was exposed to many different kinds of culture
        because Malaysia is a multicultural country.Our family has strong family
        values. My parents always teach us to work hard and take care of our
        family members, especially my mum. My mum is one of the biggest
        influences in my life. She will always “discipline” me when I was young
        and teach me to work hard and to be strong.
      </p>

      <h3>Strength (Hard working, enthusiastic and supportive)</h3>
      <p>
        My strengths have allowed me to achieve some of my goals in my life. For
        example, while working in the supermarket, I was very hard working and
        enthusiastic to learn how to do the order and negotiate with the
        supplier. I was also teaching and sharing new knowledge to my new and
        old colleagues.
      </p>
      <h3>Weakness (Shy, Repress my feeling and overload myself)</h3>
      <p>
        My weaknesses have given me problems in my life. For example, while
        working in the supermarket, sometimes I overwork myself because I didn’t
        express my thoughts to my colleagues and managers. I am bad at
        expressing my feelings to other people because maybe when I was young,
        my mum always taught me to be strong and show no emotion. Currently, I
        am trying to understand and improve myself by reading more books and
        trying to express more my feelings to other people.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Ethical decision, experience resistance or tension from the experiences
      </h3>
      <p>
        In my previous work experiences, working as a team is very important. I
        remember when I was a supervisor at a supermarket running the promotion
        team. One of my member not working well with my team and sometimes he
        just decides to not show up for work so I have to make a decision to
        remove him from my team because it is not fair to the other members.
        This decision has given my team a better work environment but it did
        cause friction between me and him.
