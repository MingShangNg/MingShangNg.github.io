      <h2>Javascript , HTML & CSS</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript (JS) is the most popular text-based programming language that
        allows users to make web pages interactive. HypeText Markup Language
        (HTML) is the standard markup language for defining the structure of the
        web content. Cascading Style Sheets is (CSS) a style sheet language used
        for styling the presentation of web content. These three languages work
        together to allow users to create web pages and web applications.
      </p>
      <h3>Analogy for Javascript, HTML and CSS</h3>
      <p>
        Think like our human body. HTML is like a skeleton. It provides our body
        structure. CSS is like skin and hair. It provides style to our body (eg,
        different colour of skin, hair). Javascript is like the brain. It allows
        us to interact.
      </p>
      <h3>Control flow and Loops</h3>
      <p>
        By default the control flow of Javascript runs the code from the first
        line on top to the end line on bottom, however we can change the control
        flow by setting up some statements such as loops. Changing the control
        flow allows the application to be more interactive and dynamic. Loops
        are one of the statements that let flow keep running until there is
        either nothing left to loop over, or if the condition becomes false.
      </p>
      <p>Example of control flow for daily life will be:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Hungry</li>
        <li>Cooking</li>
        <li>eating</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Example of loop for daily life will be:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Hungry</li>
        <li>Cooking</li>
        <li>Eating</li>
        <li>If still hungry</li>
        <li>Cook</li>
        <li>Eat</li>
        <li>Loop again till not hungry</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>DOM and an example interact with it.</h3>
      <p>
        The DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface
        that allows users to interact with the elements from the document.
        Document is just a webpage such as an HTML document. Objects are the
        elements in the HTML such as the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>. The model
        describes the object layout such as tree branches. All elements in the
        HTML are nodes and we can use it for manipulation by using
        (getElementsById, getElementsByTagName, etc).
      </p>
      <h3>Arrays and Object</h3>
      <p>
        In order to understand arrays and objects. We need to understand
        variables. In JavaScript, we can use variables to store any data value
        by using the syntax var, let and const. Objects are mutable data
        structures in javascript which are used to represent a “Thing” with
        characteristics. In objects, these characteristics are called properties
        that consist of a key and a value. let object = { key : ‘value’.}
        Properties in objects can be accessed by using either dot or bracket
        notation. Person.age return or person [‘age’].Arrays are variables which
        can store multiple values by using special syntax let i = [].Every value
        inside the array is using zero-based indexing so it means the first
        value in an array has index 0, second value will be index of 1 and so
        on. We can use this index to access the information from the array.
      </p>
      <h3>Function</h3>
      <p>
        In Javascript, function is the fundamental build block of code designed
        to perform a particular task. A function will execute when the user
        invokes it (calls it). A function definition consists of the function
        keyword, followed by name of function, a list of parameters to the
        function () and statements that define the function {}.For example,
        function name(parameters){}. Functions are very useful because they
        allow the user to create an interactive application.
